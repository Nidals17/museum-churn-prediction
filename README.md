# Churn Prediction for Italian Museum Subscribers

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze subscriber behavior in Italian museums to understand the drivers of churn and predict future churners using machine learning models.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains demographic, behavioral, and transactional information about museum subscribers.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Analyze subscriber behavior
- Identify churn patterns
- Build and evaluate churn prediction models

## 🧪 Methods Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, ROC, Precision-Recall)

## 📈 Key Results
- Tree-based models outperform Logistic Regression
- Random Forest provides the most stable performance
- Age and visit frequency are strong churn indicators

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
